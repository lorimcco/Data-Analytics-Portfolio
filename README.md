# Lorien McComb: Data Analytics Portfolio

My name is Lorien McComb. As a Data Analyst with a background in mathematics education, I bring a passion for math and precision to answering questions with data, using my experience working with Excel, SQL, Tableau and Python.

I am an analytical problem-solver whose curiosity and high attention to detail drives me to uncover hidden insights in data. My strong eye for design and visual communication allows me to share those insights effectively.

My background as a math educator combines mathematical fluency with engaging presentation and explanation skills. My commitment to continuous learning and a growth mindset enhance my work in Data Analytics.

To facilitate my career change, I took a Data Analytics Immersive Bootcamp from Juno College of Technology. This full-time 9-week program covers all elements of the ETL pipeline. Specifically, I honed skills in Google Sheets, SQL, Tableau, and Python (including Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn). 

Please explore my projects to see samples of my work.
